=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBD::IngresII is a database driver for the perl DBI system that allows
access to Ingres databases. It is built on top of the standard DBI
extension and implements the methods that DBI requires.

This document describes the differences between the "generic" DBD and
DBD::IngresII.

=head1 EXTENSIONS/CHANGES

=head2 Connect

  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:dbname[;options]");
  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:dbname[;options]", user [, password]);
  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:dbname[;options]", user [, password], \%attr);

To use DBD::IngresII call C<connect> specifying a I<datasource> option beginning
with I<"DBI:Ingres:">, followed by the database instance name and
optionally a semi-colon followed by any Ingres connect options.

Options must be given exactly as they would be given in an ESQL-connect
statement, i.e., separated by blanks.

The connect call will result in a connect statement like:

  CONNECT dbname IDENTIFIED BY user PASSWORD password OPTIONS=options

E.g.,

=over 4

=item *

local database

  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:mydb", "me", "mypassword")

=item *

with options and no password

  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:mydb;-Rmyrole/myrolepassword", "me")

=item *

Ingres/Net database

  DBI->connect("DBI:Ingres:thatnode::thisdb;-xw -l", "him", "hispassword")

=back

and so on.

=head2 AutoCommit Defaults to ON

B<Important>: The DBI spec defines that AutoCommit is B<ON> after connect.
This is the opposite of the normal Ingres default (autocommit B<OFF>).

To reflect this behavior in your code, it is recommended that the
C<connect> call ends with the attributes C<{ AutoCommit =E<gt> 0 }>.

=head2 Returned Types

The DBI docs state that:

=over 4

=item *

Most data is returned to the perl script as strings (null values are
returned as undef).  This allows arbitrary precision numeric data to be
handled without loss of accuracy.  Be aware that perl may not preserve
the same accuracy when the string is used as a number.

=back

This is B<not> the case for Ingres.

Data is returned as it would be to an embedded C program:

=over 4

=item *

Integers are returned as integer values (IVs in perl-speak).

=item *

Floats and doubles are returned as numeric values (NVs in perl-speak).

=item *

Dates, moneys, chars, varchars and others are returned as strings
(PVs in perl-speak).

=back

This does not cause loss of precision, because the Ingres API uses
these types to return the data anyway.

=head2 get_dbevent

This non-DBI method calls C<GET DBEVENT> and C<INQUIRE_INGRES> to
fetch a pending database event. If called without argument a blocking
C<GET DBEVENT WITH WAIT> is called. A numeric argument results in a
call to C<GET DBEVENT WITH WAIT= :seconds>.

In a second step
C<INQUIRE_INGRES> is called to fetch the related information, wich is
returned as a reference to a hash with keys C<name>, C<database>,
C<text>, C<owner> and C<time>. The values are the C<dbevent>* values
received from Ingres. If no event was fetched, C<undef> is returned.
See F<t/event.t> for an example of usage.

  $event_ref = $dbh->func(10, 'get_dbevent')     # wait 10 secs at most
  $event_ref = $dbh->func('get_dbevent')         # blocks

  for (keys %$event_ref) {
    printf "%-20s = '%s'\n", $_, $event_ref->{$_};
  }

=head2 do

$dbh->do is implemented as a call to 'EXECUTE IMMEDIATE' with all the
limitations that this implies. An exception to that are the DML statements
C<INSERT>, C<DELETE> and C<UPDATE>. For them, a call to C<PREPARE> is
made, possible existing parameters are bound and a subsequent C<EXECUTE>
does the job. C<SELECT> isn't supported since $dbh->do doesn't give back
a statement handler hence no way to retrieve data.

=head2 Binary Data

Fetching binary data from char and varchar fields is not guaranteed
to work, but probably will most of the time.  Use 'BYTE' or
'BYTE VARYING' data types in your database for full binary data support.

=head2 Long Data Types

DBD::IngresII supports the LONG VARCHAR and LONG BYTE data types
as detailed in L<DBI/"Handling BLOB / LONG / Memo Fields">.

The default value for LongReadLen in DBD::IngresII is 2GB, the maximum
size of a long data type field.  DBD::IngresII dynamically allocates
memory for long data types as required, so setting LongReadLen to a
large value does not waste memory.

In summary:

=over 4

=item *

When inserting blobs, use bind variables with types specified.

=item *

When fetching blobs, set LongReadLen and LongTruncOk in the $dbh.

=item *

Blob fields are returned as undef if LongReadLen is 0.

=back

Due to their size (and hence the impracticality of copying them inside
the DBD driver), variables bound as blob types are always evaluated at
execute time rather than bind time. (Similar to bind_param_inout, except
you don't pass them as references.)

=head2 ing_readonly

Normally cursors are declared C<READONLY> to increase speed. READONLY
cursors don't create exclusive locks for all the rows selected; this is
the default.

If you need to update a row then you will need to ensure that either

=over 4

=item *

the C<select> statement contains an C<for update of> clause, or

=item *

the C<$dbh-E<gt>prepare> calls includes the attribute
C<{ing_readonly =E<gt> 0}>.

=back

E.g.,

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("select ....", {ing_readonly => 0});

will be opened for update, as will

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("select .... for direct update of ..")

while

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("select .... for direct update of ..",
                       { ing_readonly => 1} );

will be opened C<FOR READONLY>.

When you wish to actually do the update, where you would normally put the
cursor name, you put:

  $sth->{CursorName}

instead,  for example:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("select a,b,c from t for update of b");
  $sth->execute;
  $row = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref;
  $dbh->do("update t set b='1' where current of $sth->{CursorName}");

Later you can reexecute the statement without the update-possibility by doing:

  $sth->{ing_readonly} = 1;
  $sth->execute;

and so on. B<Note> that an C<update> will now cause an SQL error.

In fact the "FOR UPDATE" seems to be optional, i.e., you can update
cursors even if their SELECT statements do not contain a C<for update>
part.

If you wish to update such a cursor you B<must> include the C<ing_readonly>
attribute.

B<NOTE> DBD::IngresII version later than 0.19_1 have opened all cursors for
update. This change breaks that behaviour. Sorry if this breaks your code.

=head2 ing_rollback

The DBI docs state that 'Changing C<AutoCommit> from off to on will
trigger a C<commit>'.

Setting ing_rollback to B<on> will change that to 'Changing C<AutoCommit>
from off to on will trigger a C<rollback>'.

Default value is B<off>.

B<NOTE> Since DBD::IngresII version 0.53 ing_rollback has also an impact
on the behavior on C<disconnect> . Earlier versions always did a
C<rollback>, when disconnecting while a transaction was active. Now
despite the state of C<AutoCommit> the action (rollback/commit) is
determined on the state of C<ing_rollback>. If it's on, a rollback is
done, otherwise a commit takes place. So if C<AutoCommit> is off, and
you disconnect without commiting, all your work would be treated like
one big transaction.

Please take that in mind: This is just due to compatibility to other
databases. Correct would be a C<commit> at the end of the transaction,
before disconnecting...

=head2 ing_statement

This has long been deprecated in favor of C<$sth-E<gt>{Statement}>,
which is a DBI standard.

$sth->{ing_statement} provides access to the SQL statement text.

=head2 ing_types

  $sth->{ing_types}              (\@)

Returns an array of the "perl"-type of the return fields of a select
statement.

The types are represented as:

=over 4

=item 'i': integer

All integer types, i.e., int1, int2 and int4.

These values are returned as integers. This should not cause loss of
precision as the internal Perl integer is at least 32 bit long.

=item 'f': float

The types float, float8 and money.

These values are returned as floating-point numbers. This may cause loss
of precision, but that would occur anyway whenever an application
referred to the data (all Ingres tools fetch these values as
floating-point numbers)

=item 'l': long / blob

Either of the two long datatypes, long varchar or long byte.

=item 's': string

All other supported types, i.e., char, varchar, text, date etc.

=back

=head2 Ingres Types and their DBI Equivalents

  $sth->TYPE                       (\@)

short -> DBI::SQL_SMALLINT

=item *

int -> DBI::SQL_INTEGER

=item *

float -> DBI::SQL_DOUBLE

=head2 ing_lengths

  $sth->{ing_lengths}              (\@)

Returns an array containing the lengths of the fields in Ingres, eg. an
int2 will return 2, a varchar(7) 7 and so on.

Note that money and date fields will have length returned as 0.

C<$sth-E<gt>{SqlLen}> is the same as C<$sth-E<gt>{ing_lengths}>,
but the use of it is deprecated.

See also the C<$sth-E<gt>{PRECISION}> field in the DBI docs. This returns
a 'reasonable' value for all types including money and date-fields.

=head2 ing_sqltypes

    $sth->{ing_sqltypes}              (\@)

Returns an array containing the Ingres types of the fields. The types
are given as documented in the Ingres SQL Reference Manual.

All values are positive as the nullability of the field is returned in
C<$sth-E<gt>{NULLABLE}>.

See also the C<$sth-E<gt>{TYPE}> field in the DBI docs.

=head2 ing_ph_ingtypes

    $sth->{ing_ph_ingtypes}           (\@)
    
Returns an array containing the Ingres types of the columns the
placeholders represent. This is a guess from the context of the
placeholder in the prepared statement. Be aware, that the guess
isn't always correct and sometypes a zero (illegal) type is returned.
Plus negative values indicate nullability of the parameter.
A C<$sth-E<gt>{ing_ph_nullable}> field is to be implemented yet.

=head2 ing_ph_inglengths

    $sth->{ing_ph_inglengths}         (\@)

Returns an array containing the lengths of the placeholders analog to
the $sth->{ing_lengths} field.

=head2 ing_utf8_quote
    
    # Returns q{U&'Chrz\+000105szcz'}
    $dbh->ing_utf8_quote('Chrząszcz');

Returns quoted string (which prevents SQL injection) with escaped UTF-8
literals.

=head1 FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTED

=head2 state

  $h->state                (undef)

SQLSTATE is not implemented.

=head2 disconnect_all

Not implemented

=head2 commit and rollback invalidate open cursors

DBD::IngresII should warn when a commit or rollback is isssued on a $dbh
with open cursors.

Possibly a commit/rollback should also undef the $sth's. (This should
probably be done in the DBI-layer as other drivers will have the same
problems).

After a commit or rollback the cursors are all ->finish'ed, i.e., they
are closed and the DBI/DBD will warn if an attempt is made to fetch
from them.

A future version of DBD::IngresII wil possibly re-prepare the statement.

This is needed for

=head2 Cached statements

A new feature in DBI that is not implemented in DBD::IngresII.

=head2 bind_param_inout (Procedure calls)

It is possible to call database procedures from DBD::IngresII. It is B<NOT>
possible to get return values from the procedure.

A solution is underway for support for procedure calls from the DBI.
Until that is defined procedure calls can be implemented as a
DB::Ingres-specific function (like L<get_event>) if the need arises and
someone is willing to do it.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 $dbh->table_info, $dbh->column_info, $dbh->get_info 

The table_info and column_info functions are just working against tables.
Views and synonyms still have to be implemented. The get_info function
returns just the newer version strings correctly, since I'm still looking
for documentation for the older ones.

I wonder if I have forgotten something?

=head1 AUTHORS

DBI/DBD was developed by Tim Bunce, <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk>, who also
developed the DBD::Oracle that is the closest we have to a generic DBD
implementation.

Henrik Tougaard, <htoug@cpan.org> developed the DBD::IngresII extension.

Stefan Reddig, <sreagle@cpan.org> is currently (2008) adopting it to
include some more features.
